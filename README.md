McDonald's uses market segmentation to target different groups of customers effectively. They focus on demographics (age, gender, income), psychographics (lifestyles, preferences), behaviors (eating habits, occasions), and geographic locations. This strategy helps them tailor menus and promotions to diverse customer needs and preferences across various markets.
